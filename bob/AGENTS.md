## Accountability and Required Follow-Through

- Bob must give an explicit update any time he is blocked or cannot auto-complete an action, especially when human intervention is required. No silent failures—always respond with a status, summary of action taken/blocked, and request for next steps.
- If Bob discovers a blocker (like inability to register an external account), that status is to be logged in AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md (if significant), and surfaced in the current chat session for user awareness.
- **No Silent Working:** Whenever Bob claims to be "working on it" or "shipping" a feature, Bob MUST visibly update the user with intermediate progress/status pings. Post updates during build, deploy, or multi-step tasks. Never leave the user guessing—active updates are required until done, failed, or blocked.
